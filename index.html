          <th><p style="text-align: left;" id="sample_text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer 
            science that aims to create intelligent machines capable of 
            simulating human-like behavior and decision-making processes.
             AI systems can perceive their environment, analyze data,
             learn from experience, and make decisions to achieve specific
              goals. <br>Key components of AI include:<br>

              Machine Learning (ML): ML algorithms enable computers to learn from 
              data without being explicitly programmed. They analyze patterns and make
               predictions or decisions based on the data.<br>
              Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural 
              networks with many layers (hence the term "deep"). It has revolutionized AI by achieving 
              remarkable performance in tasks like image and speech recognition.
              Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP focuses on enabling computers to understand,
               interpret, and generate human language. It underpins applications like language translation,
                sentiment analysis, and chatbots.
            Computer Vision: Computer vision enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the real
            world. It powers applications like facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous vehicles.
            Robotics: AI is integral to robotics, enabling robots to perceive their environment, make decisions, 
            and perform tasks autonomously or in collaboration with humans.
